Ok so this game is pretty similar to the original plants vs zombies, here are the controls:

-left click: pickup sun, select plant, plant plant
-right click: deselect plant, remove plant

And that is basically it, for actually starting the game you just need to run the launcher. After running the launcher you will be prompted with the level you wish to play and you should enter the level you want to play, eg: "night:1" or "day:2", you must enter location followed by a colon followed by the level number. There are currently only two locations with 3 levels each, but you can easily create your own levels by creating a new folder in the location file, for example you could create a folder "data/locations/night/4" and then place a data.json file into the folder, just copy and paste the data from another level's data.json in, and you can change some of the values, remember you must have at least 1 wave for the game to function. If you wish to add plants or zombies it is very easy as well, all you have to do is go the desinated location, create a folder with the name of the plant/zombies, create a sprite, and a data.json. For example, if you wish to add a plant, lets say the cherry bomb, you can just create the folder "data/plants/cherrybomb" then you need a sprite and data.json, then just like copy the data from another plant's data.json, and you can modify the values, it might be a little bit of work to figure out, the plant has an attack and a tick function, if you dont specify one of them it will default to the one in the main file however you can write your own custom one, it is pretty similar for the zombies. You can read the code, the game is pretty customizable, just like modify the values in the json files, you don't actually really need to know how to code to customize this game.
